This project is just a basic implementation of Linked Lists. The code itself has more functionality (like insertAt, removeAt, and contains to name a few). However, to reduce its complexity, the UI only supports insertion and deletion at the head and the tail of the linkedlist and doesn't support contains and the other methods of the linkedlist class. Also, I have to admit that the UI isn't good at all haha.
